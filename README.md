# Fretboard Trainer

> Memorize the fretboard quickly

This was built as an exploration project to see where Redux was after a few years away from it, and what it looks like now that React Hooks have landed. It seems to be doing ðŸ‘Œin the form of [easy-peasy](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/easy-peasy), a library that abstracts away some of the more verbose vanilla Redux patterns into an easy-to-use yet fully-backwards-compatable wrapper. (It also has really **excellent** TypeScript support.)
